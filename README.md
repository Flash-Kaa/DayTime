## You can also view the history in which you can mark the completion of the activity, delete or repeat the activity. This will help you analyze your employment and determine what you can spend less time on and what you should pay more attention to. With this application, you can find time to learn new languages, to read a book that you haven't been able to read for a long time, to study or just relax.
