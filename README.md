# DayTime
DayTime is an android application where you can mark your activities during the day (for example: tidying up, sleeping, working or just watching videos with kittens). 
So, in the evening you can see which activity took you the most time, and think about how to manage your time more optimally. Thanks to this, your next days will be more productive and/or more relaxing.


PS My first independent android application :)
